# Add new inflection rules using the following format. Inflections
# are locale specific, and you may define rules for as many different
# locales as you wish. All of these examples are active by default:
ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections do |inflect|
  inflect.irregular("animal", "animais")
  inflect.irregular("historico_animal", "historicos_animais")
  inflect.irregular("especie", "especies")
end

# These inflection rules are supported but not enabled by default:
# ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
#   inflect.acronym "RESTful"
# end
